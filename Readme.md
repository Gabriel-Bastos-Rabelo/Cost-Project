## About

Costs Project is a financial control application for people who want to have more control over their expenses, allowing to register projects and their budgets, and put their services and costs. This application was made with react and saving the information locally in json server

This project was learning with the help of Hora de codar's youtube channel, and these series of videos were really useful for developing my skills on react.
